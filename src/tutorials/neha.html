    <h1><a href="#explanation">The how of Goulash Mahjong</a></h1>

    <p>
        Goulash Mahjong is a four-player tile game where players compete to form a
        winning "hand" of 14 tiles, arranged as four triplets (Pungs or Kongs, which are either identical tiles or sequences within the same suit) and a pair (two identical tiles). Additionally, Goulash Mahjong requires players to fulfill specific conditions to declare a win.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game uses 152 tiles, consisting of three numbered suits, two types of "honor" tiles split into "winds" and "dragons", bonus tiles, and Joker tiles. Specifically:

<section id="setup">
    <h2><a href="#setup">Pre-Game Setup</a></h2>

    <p>
        Before starting the game, the following setup steps are necessary:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Players:</strong> Goulash Mahjong is played with four players.</li>
        <li><strong>Shuffling and Building the Wall:</strong> All 152 tiles are shuffled face down, and each player builds a wall in front of their rack consisting of two rows of tiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Determining the East Player:</strong> Each player rolls the dice, and the player with the highest roll becomes the East (dealer). The player to the right of East is South, followed by West and North.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="gameplay">
    <h2><a href="#gameplay">Game Play</a></h2>

    <p>
        Core gameplay begins after the pre-game setup. Players take turns drawing a tile and discarding one, aiming to complete their hand of 14 tiles. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The "actual game" part comes in the form of "claims", where players may claim a tile as it is being discarded if they can use that tile to form specific sets.
    </p>

    <h3 id="charleston"><a href="#charleston">Charleston</a></h3>

    <p>
        Players begin by exchanging three tiles with the opposite member (East with West, South with North). Then, East exchanges tiles with the right member, then with the left member. This process repeats until each player has exchanged tiles three times.
    </p>

    <h3 id="draw-discard"><a href="#draw-discard">Tile Draw and Discard</a></h3>

    <p>
        The East player starts by discarding a tile. Players then take turns drawing one tile from the wall and discarding one from their hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a discarded tile completes a Pung or Kong in another player’s hand, they may claim it, show the set, and continue play.
    </p>

<section id="rules">
    <h2><a href="#rules">Winning Conditions and Rules</a></h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Two Pungs of Dragons or Winds, with at least one Pung of the player’s own wind.</li>
                <li>Two of the player’s own flowers, or a combination of one flower and one Pung of Winds or Dragons.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fishing:</strong> When a player needs only one tile to win, they must declare "Fishing" and place a colored token on their stand. They must call "Mahjong" upon drawing the winning tile.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="scoring">
    <h2><a href="#scoring">Scoring</a></h2>

    <p>
        Scoring in Goulash Mahjong is determined based on specific sets and patterns, with additional points and conditions outlined in the Goulash scoring system.
    </p>

    <h3>Special Scoring Rules:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hands from Heaven:</strong> If the East player wins after the Charleston or if any player wins from East’s first discard, the score is doubled.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="penalties">
    <h2><a href="#penalties">Additional Rules and Penalties</a></h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Erroneous Discards:</strong> Once a tile is discarded and announced, it cannot be taken back.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect Calls:</strong> If a tile is called incorrectly and no exposure is made, the call may be retracted. If exposure is made, it must be corrected before discarding.</li>
        <li><strong>Dead Hands:</strong> If a player has an incorrect number of tiles, their hand is considered dead but they still pay the winner.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect Mahjong Call:</strong> If a player incorrectly declares Mahjong without exposing the hand, no penalty is applied, and the game continues. If the hand is exposed incorrectly, the hand is dead, and the player pays the winner.</li>
    </ul>
